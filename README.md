This guide provides all the information needed to start creating web applications with Webix Jet. The book is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/webix-hub/gitbook-webix-jet), so you can watch the repo to get the updates.

Webix is a library of UI components and you don’t need any special techniques to create apps with it.

This guide will provide you with an easy and convenient way of creating apps with Webix by means of using Webix Jet framework.
