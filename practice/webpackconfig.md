# <span id="contents">Webpack Config</span>

There are some cases when you might want to change the default webpack configuration.

- [Multiple Start Files](#multiple_start)
- [Turning Off Localization and Views](#turn_off)

### [<span id="multiple_start">Multiple Start Files &uarr;</span>](#contents)

By default, the app is built with one start file:

```js
/* webpack.config.js */
...
var config = {
		entry: "./sources/admin.js",
		output: {
			//...
			filename: "admin.js"
		},
    ...
}
...
```

To create multiple entry files, pass an object to **entry** and use the *[name]* substitution for output filenames to ensure that each file has a unique name:

```js
/* webpack.config.js */
{
    entry: {
        admin: "./sources/admin.js",
        orders: "./sources/orders.js"
    },
    output: {
        //...
        filename: "[name].js"
    }
}
```

### [<span id="turn_off">Turning Off Localization and Views &uarr;</span>](#contents)

If you aren't planning to localize the app, there's a way to do it without creating and empty folder for locales. Without changes in webpack config, you would have to do that to get the app compiled. webpack config has the **resolve** property that presents options affecting the resolving of modules. It tells webpack where to look for locales or some other files, e.g. views. Change the path in the *"jet-locales"* key pair from **resolve.alias**.

```js
/* webpack.config.js */
var config = {
    ...
    resolve: {
        extensions: [".js"],
        modules: ["./sources", "node_modules"],
        alias:{
            "jet-views":path.resolve(__dirname, "sources/views"),
            "jet-locales":path.resolve(__dirname, "sources/locales") //change me
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

Besides, if you do not want webpack to look for views in the **sources/views** folder, modify the *"jet-views"* key pair as well. And you can change the *"./sources"* directory for your modules as well.
