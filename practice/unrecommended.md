# Unrecommended, but Possible Solutions

## Dynamic Layout Rebuilding

**Task:** you want to rebuild the existing view or replace some component in it

**Solution:** use **addView()** of Webix views

**addView** is a Webix method of layout widgets like Form, MultiView, etc. You can use it to add Webix components to Jet views as well. Yet, it will work a little differently. The point is that **addView** uses regular webix.ui pattern of view initialization, which does not work with the Jet *$scope*. So, apart from the Webix view configuration that is usually passed to **addView** as a parameter, you must set **$scope** to **this**:

```js
someWebixView.addView({ $scope:this, view:"someWebixView" /* the rest of config */} [,position])
```

Have a look at the example. This is a Jet class view with a small Webix form:

```js
// views/start.js
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";

export default class StartView extends JetView {
	config(){
		return {
			view:"form", width:300, elements:[
				{ view:"button", value:"Add a button" }
			]
		};
	}
}
```

Let's dynamically add a button and define a class method **changeView** for that. To reference the Webix form from the method, use **this.getRoot()**, where *this* is the Jet class view and *getRoot* returns the form.

```js
// views/start.js
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";

export default class StartView extends JetView {
	config(){
		return {
			view:"form", width:300, elements:[
				{ view:"button", value:"Add a button", click: () => {
					this.changeView();
				} }
			]
		};
	}
	changeView(){
		this.getRoot().addView({
            $scope: this, 
            view:"button", 
            value:"Added" 
        });
	}
}
```
