# Models

View modules return the UI configuration of the components. They describe the visual aspect of an application and shouldn't contain any data. For data, there is another type of modules - a **model**. Models are JS files that are placed in a separate folder. This division of UI and data is an advantage because if the data changes, all you have to do is change the data model. There's no need to modify view files. 

There are several ways of loading data in Webix Jet.

### 1. Shared Data

If you have some relatively small data and plan to use them in many components, you can create a model, initialize a data collection in it and load the data into the data collection. Here's an example of a data collection with static data:

```js
/* sources/models/records.js */
export const data = new webix.DataCollection({ data:[
	{ id:1, title:"The Shawshank Redemption", year:1994, votes:678790, rating:9.2, rank:1},
	{ id:2, title:"The Godfather", year:1972, votes:511495, rating:9.2, rank:2},
	//...other records
]});
```

This is how the data is loaded and saved to the server:

```js
/* sources/models/records.js */
export const data = new webix.DataCollection({ 
	url:"data.php",
	save:"data.php"
});
```

To use the data in a component, you need to parse it. You must parse data in **init**, not in **config**. Have a look at an example with a datatable:

```js
/* sources/views/data.js */
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";
import {records} from "models/records";

export default class DataView extends JetView{
	config(){
		return { view:"datatable", autoConfig:true, editable:true };
	}
	init(view){
		view.parse(records);
	}
}
```

All the changes made in the datatable are saved to the server.

### 2. Dynamic Data

This is the model for big data. These data can be used only once and mustn't be cached. The data can be loaded from a server with an AJAX request:

```js
/* sources/models/records.js */
export default {
	getData: function(){
		return webix.ajax("data.php");
	}
}
```

or from local storage:

```js
/* sources/models/records.js */
export default {
	getData: function(){
		return webix.storage.local.get("data");
	}
}
```

To parse data, use *getData*:

```js
/* sources/views/data.js */
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";
import * as records from "../models/records";
export default class DataView extends JetView{
	config(){ return { view:"datatable", autoConfig:true }; }
	init(view) { 
		view.parse(records.getData());
	}
}
```

To save data, you can add a function to the *records* model:

```js
/* sources/models/records.js */
export default {
	getData: function(){
		return webix.ajax("data.php");
	},
	saveData: function(){
		//...
	}
}
```

In *init* you need to define a way to save data:

```js
/* sources/views/data.js */
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";
import * as records from "../models/records";
export default class DataView extends JetView{
	config(){ return { view:"datatable", autoConfig:true, editable:true }; }
	init(view) {
		view.parse(records.getData());
		view.define("save", records.saveData);
	}
}
```

Loading and saving data can be done in **config** of the view module:

```js
/* sources/views/data.js */
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";
import * as records from "../models/records";
export default class DataView extends JetView{
	config() {
		return {
			view:"datatable", autoConfig:true,
			url: records.getData,
			save: records.saveData
		}
	}
}
```

### 3. Huge Data

For really huge data (more than 10K records), you can use dynamic loading of Webix components. Data will be loaded in portions when needed. For that, you must give up models and load data in the view code. You can do it with the **url** property:

```js
/* sources/views/data.js */
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";

export default class DataView extends JetView{
	config(){
		return { 
			view:"datatable", autoConfig:true,
			url:"data.php",
			save:"data.php" 
		};
	}
}
```

or with the **load** method:

```js
/* sources/views/data.js */
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";

export default class DataView extends JetView{
	config(){
		var ui = { view:"datatable", autoConfig:true };
		ui.load("data.php");
		return ui;
	}
}
```

### 4. Services as Data Sources

You can use services instead of models as data sources. Suppose there's a list of customers and a grid that displays records on a selected customer. Here's how you can use a service that returns the ID of a selected list item:

```js
var id = service.getSelected();
var data = records.getData(id);
```

A better and shorter way is:

```js
var data = service.getNomenclature();
```

### 5. Using Webix Remote with Webix Jet

You can use [webix.remote](https://docs.webix.com/desktop__webix_remote_php.html) instead of sending AJAX requests. You must have a server-side script:

```html
<script src="api.php"></script>
```

with a *nm* class like this:

```php
class Nomencl {
	public function getNomenclature(id) { /*...*/}
}
$api->setClass("nm", new Nomencl());
```

Here's a model:

```js
/* sources/models/nomencl.js */
export webix.remote.nm;
```

You can import the model and parse it into a view component:

```js
/* sources/views/data.js */
import records from "../models/nomencl"
...
init(view){
	view.parse(records.getNomenclature(id));
}
```

**remote** is better then an AJAX request for several reasons. First, you don't need to serialize data after loading. Compare the results of these two requests:

```js
var data1 = webix.ajax("data/nomencl/154"); 		//"{id:154,name:"John"}"
var data2 = webix.remote.nm.getNomenclature(154);	//{id:154,name:"John"}
```

After receiving the response of the AJAX request, you have to call <code>JSON.parse(data1)</code> to turn a string into an object. The response of the second request is already an object.

Second, requests with *webix.remote* are safer due to CSRF-security. And third, several requests are sent as one, which makes operations faster.
