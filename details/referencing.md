## Referencing Views from Webix UI Events

In the new version of Webix Jet, there is a convenient reference to a view from Webix UI events with the **this** pointer. Consider the following use-cases.

**1.Reference to the view**

If you want to change the URL from controls of the view, reference the view with **this.$scope**:

```js
/* views/toolbar.js */
export const Toolbar = {
    view: "toolbar",
    elements: [
        { view: "label", label: "Demo" },
        { view: "button", value:"Details",
            click: function() {
                this.$scope.show(this.getValue())
            }
    }]
};
```

If you prefer a shorter syntax, let the handler be an arrow function. Then simply use **this** for view reference:

```js
/* views/toolbar.js */
export const Toolbar = {
    view: "toolbar",
    elements: [
        { view: "label", label: "Demo" },
        { view: "button", value:"Details",
            click: () => {
                this.show(this.getValue())
            }
    }]
};
```

**2.Reference to the app**

**this.$scope.app** references the app that encloses the view. This is useful if you want to rebuild the app UI. Let's shorten the syntax with an arrow function again:

```js
/* views/toolbar.js */
export class ToolbarView extends JetView {
    config() {
        return {
            view: "toolbar",
            elements: [
                { view: "label", label: "Demo" },
                { view: "button", value:"Details",
                    click: () => {
                        this.app.show("/" + this.getValue())
                    }
            }]
        };
    }
}
```

**3.Reference to the root UI element of the view**

Suppose you have a view with a form and you want to validate its input when users click **Submit**. To refer to the form itself and not the whole view, use **this.$scope.getRoot\(\)**. It references the root UI element returned by config. In an arrow function the reference is **this.getRoot\(\)**:

```js
/* views/form.js */
export class FormView extends JetView{
    config(){
        return { 
            view:"form", elements:[
                { view:"text", name:"email", required:true, label:"Email" },
                { view:"button", value:"save", 
                    click: () => {
                        if (this.getRoot().validate())
                            this.show("Details");
                    } 
                }
            ]
        };
    }
}
```

**4.Using plugins**

Form validation can be implemented in one more way - with a plugin **UnloadGard**. The plugin reacts to an attempt of changing the URL. The syntax for using a plugin is _this.use\(plugin,handler\)_. Use takes two parameters:

* a plugin name
* a function that will handle the **Unload** event

Now validation is moved from the **Save** button handler to the plugin handler:

```js
class FormView extends JetView {
    config(){
        return { 
            view:"form", elements:[
                { view:"text", name:"email", required:true, label:"Email" },
                { view:"button", value:"save", click:() => this.show("Details") }
            ]
        };
    }
    init(ui, url){
        this.use(JetApp.plugins.UnloadGuard, () => {
            if (this.getRoot().validate())
                return true;

            return new Promise((res, rej) => {
                webix.confirm({
                    text: "Are you sure ?",
                    callback: a => a ? res() : rej()
                })
            });
        });
    }
}
```

If the input isn't valid, the function returns a promise with a dialogue window. Depending on the answer, the promise either resolves and the Guard lets the user go to the next view, or it rejects. No pasaran.

**5.Referencing nested views and controls**

You already know how to change the URL by controls. Now have a look how the state of controls can be changed by the URL. For example, if you have a toolbar with a segmented button that is used to switch between two views:

```js
class ToolbarView extends JetView {
    config() {
        return {
            view: "toolbar",
            elements: [
                { view: "label", label: "Demo" }, 
                {
                    view: "segmented", localId: "control", options: ["Details", "Dash"],
                    click: function() {
                        this.$scope.app.show("/Demo/" + this.getValue())
                    }
            }]
        };
    }
}
```

This works fine, however, if you switch to Dash and reload the page, the segmented button won't be turned to **Dash**. In more complex apps this behavior might be confusing. To fix this, use **this.$$\("localId"\)** to reference the button and set its value. **this.$$\("localId"\)** can be used to reference nested views and controls by their global or local IDs.

```js
class ToolbarView extends JetView {
    config() {
        /* same config */
    }
    init(ui, url) {
        if (url.length)
            this.$$("control").setValue(url[1].page);
    }
}
```

**6.Attaching events**

To attach events, use **this.on\(\)**, which is an alias of **attachEvent\(\)**. For more details, consider the [dedicated section](/details/events.md).

**7.Referencing UI**

To refer to the UI of the view, use **this.ui\(\)** that is a substitute for **webix.ui\(\)** familiar to those who aren't new to Webix.
